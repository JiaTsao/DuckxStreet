# DuckxStreet Globe Demo

This repository contains a static web page that showcases an interactive 3D globe built with [Globe.gl](https://github.com/vasturiano/globe.gl) and Three.js. Clicking on countries that have Instagram posts opens a modal listing those posts.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser with internet access. The globe can be rotated and zoomed. Countries with available posts are highlighted. Selecting a country opens a modal displaying the corresponding media thumbnails and captions. Clicking a thumbnail navigates to the original Instagram post in a new tab.

All media data is stored locally in `data.json` and loaded at runtime. Styling is done with Tailwind CSS.

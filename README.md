# DuckxStreet Globe Demo

This repository contains a simple static web page that displays an interactive 3D globe using [globe.gl](https://globe.gl/).

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a modern web browser with internet access. The globe can be rotated and zoomed. Clicking on a highlighted country will display a modal with placeholder Instagram posts for that country. Click on a post to open the original link in a new tab.

The demo uses Tailwind CSS for styling and a small hard-coded dataset located in `posts.js`.
